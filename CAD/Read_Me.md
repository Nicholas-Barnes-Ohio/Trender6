    *Y Linear Rails: The Y Linear Rails are MGN12.  Stock Voron uses MGN9.   The XY joints in the model and the y limit switch printed parts were updated to accomodate the MGN12 rails that I had on hand.
    *Orbiter Clock Work:  I designed my orbiter clockwork around a reversed Oribter 1.5 that I already owned.  I also added an auxillary fan to cool the Orbiter and EBB36 Driver Board.  These are not requied, the official VORON toolheads should work.
    *Cable Management:  My custom toolhead takes advanage of the reduced wire could of the CANBUS board with a spring wire supported direct wire approach.   The Trender6 frame should be compatable with standard cable chains if that is preferred.
    *Frame: The "complete" frame in the projects thumbnail is available from https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/ender-6-printer-model-for-cura
