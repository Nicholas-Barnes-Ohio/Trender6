# Trender6

This repository is in EXTREME draft mode and I am new to Github, so mistakes should be expected. The level of detail published will dependent on community interest.

Mash-up of the Ender 6 and Voron Trident.   Bringing the Trident Grantry and Stealthburner toolhead to the Ender 6's enclosed frame.  There are other projects which have brought Voron elements to the Ender 6 frame.  This version allows the design to be fully enclosed.    My version retained the stock z-axis and utilized as many stock Voron Trident parts as practical.   The main drawback is a loss of z travel.  I valued enclosablty over z-travel.

The current iteration includes a BL-Touch which reduces the x-travel.  Current travel range of the conversion is:
   *  X:   0 to 269 mm
   *  Y: -10 to 290 mm
   *  Z:  -5 to 255 mm

Stock Ender 6 build volume. 250 x 250 x 400 mm.
